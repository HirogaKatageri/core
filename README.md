# What is this Repository?

This is actually a sandbox repository I made in order to develop stuff. It started modular so I could develop libraries for my use cases. It is named "Core" because this is where I started making Wrappers for my Activities, Fragments, Services and Application for MVVM and Koin.

Eventually if a library is too big for this repository I'll make a new repository for it.

## Features

### Core

Wrappers for Activities, Fragments, Services and Applications to use with MVVM and Koin.

### View Service (In Progress)

A library to easily create and display views in a ForegroundService.

### OAuth2.0 Clients

- Twitch (Usable but still in Development)
